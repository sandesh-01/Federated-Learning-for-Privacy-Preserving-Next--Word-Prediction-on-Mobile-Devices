# **Federated Learning for Next-Word Prediction**

A privacy-preserving machine learning system for collaboratively training a next-word prediction model using Federated Learning. This project ensures data privacy by enabling decentralized devices to train models locally and share only model updates with a central server.

---

## **Features**
- Decentralized model training using Federated Averaging (FedAvg).
- Supports local data preprocessing and training on private datasets.
- Scalable design for multiple devices.
- Iterative model improvement via global aggregation.
- Privacy-preserving techniques: only model weights are shared, not data.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch (for machine learning model training)
  - NumPy (for mathematical operations)
  - Flask (for simulating client-server communication, optional)
  - Scikit-learn (for evaluation and metrics)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook for experimentation.
